          -- Quantitative_Data -- Contains all the files and data taken for the Quantitaive Analysis.

--   Additional Materials- Contains all the figures that are used to create the final paper.

Navigation for files- 
Within Each relevant folder, each document is named according to:
-- name explaining the type of data.
-- date telling about the recency of data capture.
-- version at the end to tell which version is the newer one.


Instructions for future Collaborators-
1) Depending on the type of file you are adding to the project, keep it in the relevant folder.
2) If you are changing the already created file, add you file with changed version and not edit the same file.
3) Version and date is an important aspect to know which file is recent.
4) Keep the name relevant to the data.
